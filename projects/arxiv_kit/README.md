# arXiv API Interaction Script

## Overview

This Python script interacts with the arXiv API to fetch, process, and download research papers. It provides functionality for searching the arXiv database, saving search results, and downloading papers based on their arXiv IDs.

## Features

- Search arXiv database with customizable queries
- Save search results to JSON files
- Download papers using arXiv IDs

## Dependencies

- json
- time
- urllib.request
- arxiv (pypy arxiv module)
- feedparser

## Usage

1. Search for papers:
   ```python
   results = fetch_arxiv_results("quantum computing", total_results=10)
   ```

2. Save results to JSON:
   ```python
   save_results_to_json(results, "quantum_computing_papers.json")
   ```

3. Download papers:
   ```python
   download_papers_from_file("arxiv_ids.txt")
   ```

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced search options (by author, category, date range)
- Improved data processing and storage
- Batch downloading with progress tracking
- User interface (CLI and GUI)
- Integration with reference management software
