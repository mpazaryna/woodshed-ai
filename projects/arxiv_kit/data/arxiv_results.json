        "published": "2023-08-03T19:03:18Z",
        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have found widespread applications in various\ndomains, including web applications, where they facilitate human interaction\nvia chatbots with natural language interfaces. Internally, aided by an\nLLM-integration middleware such as Langchain, user prompts are translated into\nSQL queries used by the LLM to provide meaningful responses to users. However,\nunsanitized user prompts can lead to SQL injection attacks, potentially\ncompromising the security of the database. Despite the growing interest in\nprompt injection vulnerabilities targeting LLMs, the specific risks of\ngenerating SQL injection attacks through prompt injections have not been\nextensively studied. In this paper, we present a comprehensive examination of\nprompt-to-SQL (P$_2$SQL) injections targeting web applications based on the\nLangchain framework. Using Langchain as our case study, we characterize\nP$_2$SQL injections, exploring their variants and impact on application\nsecurity through multiple concrete examples. Furthermore, we evaluate 7\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating the pervasiveness of P$_2$SQL attacks\nacross language models. Our findings indicate that LLM-integrated applications\nbased on Langchain are highly susceptible to P$_2$SQL injection attacks,\nwarranting the adoption of robust defenses. To counter these attacks, we\npropose four effective defense techniques that can be integrated as extensions\nto the Langchain framework. We validate the defenses through an experimental\nevaluation with a real-world use case application.",

        "published": "2024-06-26T07:21:02Z",
        "summary": "With the development of natural language processing (NLP), large language\nmodels (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular. LLMs are integrating more into\neveryday life, raising public concerns about their security vulnerabilities.\nConsequently, the security of large language models is becoming critically\nimportant. Currently, the techniques for attacking and defending against LLMs\nare continuously evolving. One significant method type of attack is the\njailbreak attack, which designed to evade model safety mechanisms and induce\nthe generation of inappropriate content. Existing jailbreak attacks primarily\nrely on crafting inducement prompts for direct jailbreaks, which are less\neffective against large models with robust filtering and high comprehension\nabilities. Given the increasing demand for real-time capabilities in large\nlanguage models, real-time updates and iterations of new knowledge have become\nessential. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an advanced technique to\ncompensate for the model's lack of new knowledge, is gradually becoming\nmainstream. As RAG enables the model to utilize external knowledge bases, it\nprovides a new avenue for jailbreak attacks.\n  In this paper, we conduct the first work to propose the concept of indirect\njailbreak and achieve Retrieval-Augmented Generation via LangChain. Building on\nthis, we further design a novel method of indirect jailbreak attack, termed\nPoisoned-LangChain (PLC), which leverages a poisoned external knowledge base to\ninteract with large language models, thereby causing the large models to\ngenerate malicious non-compliant dialogues.We tested this method on six\ndifferent large language models across three major categories of jailbreak\nissues. The experiments demonstrate that PLC successfully implemented indirect\njailbreak attacks under three different scenarios, achieving success rates of\n88.56%, 79.04%, and 82.69% respectively.",

        "summary": "Breast ultrasound (BUS) is a critical diagnostic tool in the field of breast\nimaging, aiding in the early detection and characterization of breast\nabnormalities. Interpreting breast ultrasound images commonly involves creating\ncomprehensive medical reports, containing vital information to promptly assess\nthe patient's condition. However, the ultrasound imaging system necessitates\ncapturing multiple images of various parts to compile a single report,\npresenting a time-consuming challenge. To address this problem, we propose the\nintegration of multiple image analysis tools through a LangChain using Large\nLanguage Models (LLM), into the breast reporting process. Through a combination\nof designated tools and text generation through LangChain, our method can\naccurately extract relevant features from ultrasound images, interpret them in\na clinical context, and produce comprehensive and standardized reports. This\napproach not only reduces the burden on radiologists and healthcare\nprofessionals but also enhances the consistency and quality of reports. The\nextensive experiments shows that each tools involved in the proposed method can\noffer qualitatively and quantitatively significant results. Furthermore,\nclinical evaluation on the generated reports demonstrates that the proposed\nmethod can make report in clinically meaningful way.",
