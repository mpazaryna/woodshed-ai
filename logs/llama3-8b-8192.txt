Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in ancient India over 5,000 years ago. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj," which means "to unite" or "to join." The practice of yoga aims to unite the individual's body, mind, and spirit, and to unite these three aspects with the external world.

In essence, yoga is a holistic approach to physical, mental, and emotional well-being, encompassing various techniques and disciplines to:

1. **Physical postures (Asanas)**: Various poses that can help improve flexibility, strength, balance, and overall physical health.
2. **Breathing techniques (Pranayama)**: Specific breathing exercises to control the life force (prana), calming the mind, and preparing the body for meditation.
3. **Meditation and relaxation**: Techniques to cultivate mental calmness, concentration, and inner peace.
4. **Philosophy and spirituality**: Principles of yoga, such as the concept of the self, the nature of reality, and the interconnectedness of all things.
