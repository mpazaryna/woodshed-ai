Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in ancient India over 5,000 years ago. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj," which means "to unite" or "to join." Yoga is a holistic practice that aims to unite the body, mind, and spirit by cultivating awareness, balance, and harmony.

There are various forms of yoga, but most styles share common goals and principles. Here are some key aspects of yoga:

1. **Physical postures (Asanas)**: Yoga consists of various poses, which can be standing, seated, or lying down. These postures can help improve flexibility, balance, strength, and range of motion.
2. **Breathing techniques (Pranayama)**: Yoga emphasizes the importance of deep, conscious breathing to calm the mind, balance the nervous system, and increase oxygenation of the body.
3. **Meditation and relaxation**: Yoga often includes meditation, visualization, or relaxation techniques to quiet the mind, reduce stress, and promote inner peace.
4. **Energy and subtle body practices**: Yoga recognizes the existence of a subtle body, including energy channels (nadi), energy centers (chakras), and the life force (prana). Techniques like pranayama, mudras, and bandhas aim to balance and harmonize these energy systems.
5. **Philosophy and spiritual practices**: Yoga is grounded in Indian philosophy, particularly in the teachings of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita. Yoga philosophy explores the nature of the self, the universe, and the interconnectedness of all phenomena.
