Yoga is an ancient Indian physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated over 5,000 years ago. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj," which means "to unite" or "to join."

Yoga is often referred to as a form of exercise, but it is much more than that. It is a holistic practice that combines physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), meditation, and mindfulness to promote overall well-being, balance, and harmony in the body, mind, and spirit.

The primary goals of yoga are:
