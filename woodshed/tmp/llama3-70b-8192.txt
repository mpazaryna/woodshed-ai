Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in ancient India over 5,000 years ago. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj," which means "to unite" or "to join." It is a holistic practice that aims to unite the body, mind, and spirit, promoting overall health, well-being, and self-awareness.

Traditionally, yoga is a spiritual practice that combines physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation to achieve a state of balance, harmony, and inner peace. The physical postures are designed to purified the body, while the breathing techniques and meditation are meant to calm the mind and focus the attention inward.
