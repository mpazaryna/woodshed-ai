Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in India over 5,000 years ago. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj" which means "to unite" or "to join."

In yoga, the physical body is used as a tool to connect with the mind and spirit. Through various postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation, yoga aims to unite the body, mind, and spirit, promoting a state of balance, harmony, and well-being.

There are various forms of yoga, each with its own unique focus and emphasis. Here are some of the most popular styles:
