Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in ancient India. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit word "yuj" which means "to unite" or "to join." Yoga involves a variety of practices, including physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), meditation (dhyana), and lifestyle practices. The ultimate goal of yoga is to achieve a state of inner peace and union with the universe.

There are many different styles and traditions of yoga, each with its own unique approach and emphasis. Some popular styles of yoga include Hatha yoga, Vinyasa yoga, Ashtanga yoga, Yin yoga, and Bikram yoga.

Yoga has many benefits for both physical and mental health. It can improve flexibility, strength, and balance, as well as reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Yoga can also help to lower blood pressure, improve lung function, and boost the immune system.
