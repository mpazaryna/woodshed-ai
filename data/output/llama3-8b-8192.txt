Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in India over 5,000 years ago. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj," which means "to unite" or "to join." Yoga is often described as the union of the body, mind, and spirit.

Yoga is a holistic practice that combines physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation to promote overall health, wellness, and self-awareness. The practice of yoga aims to unite the individual's consciousness with the Universal Consciousness, and to achieve a state of inner peace, calm, and balance.
