Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in ancient India over 5,000 years ago. The word "yoga" is derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj," meaning "to unite" or "to join."

Yoga is a holistic practice that aims to unite the body, mind, and spirit by combining physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation. The ultimate goal of yoga is to attain a state of inner peace, balance, and harmony.

There are several branches of yoga, each with its own unique focus and approach. Some of the most well-known practices include:

1. Hatha Yoga: A physical practice that focuses on postures (asanas) and breathing techniques (pranayama) to prepare the body for meditation.

8. Restorative Yoga: A gentle and restorative practice that involves using props to support the body in relaxing postures.
