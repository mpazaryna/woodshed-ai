Yoga is an ancient physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in India over 5,000 years ago. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj," meaning "to unite" or "to join."

Yoga is a holistic practice that aims to unite the body, mind, and spirit through various techniques, including:

1. **Physical postures (Asanas)**: Yoga postures help to improve flexibility, balance, strength, and overall physical health.
2. **Breathing techniques (Pranayama)**: yogic breathing helps to calm the mind, slow down the heart rate, and prepare the body for meditation.
3. **Meditation and relaxation** (Savasana, etc.): Yoga includes various methods to quiet the mind, reduce stress, and cultivate inner peace.
4. **Philosophy and ethics** (Yamas and Niyamas): Yoga is based on ancient Indian philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of living a balanced life, respecting others, and honoring the natural world.

The ultimate goal of yoga is to achieve a state of **samadhi**, or complete inner peace, by uniting the individual self (jiva) with the universal consciousness (Brahman).

There are various forms of yoga, including:

1. **Hatha Yoga**: Focuses on physical postures (Asanas) and breathing techniques (Pranayama) to prepare the body for meditation.
2. **Vinyasa Yoga**: Flow-based yoga that links movement with breath.
3. **Ashtanga Yoga**: Fast-paced, physically demanding style that involves many postures.
4. **Iyengar Yoga**: Emphasizes precise alignment, props, and sequencing.
5. **Kundalini Yoga**: Focuses on energy, kundalini (life force), and spiritual growth.
6. **Bikram Yoga**: Practiced in a heated room, emphasizing detoxification and purification.
7. **Yin Yoga**: Slow-paced, meditative style that targets deeper tissues.
8. **Restorative Yoga**: Involves using props to support the body in relaxation postures.
9. **Sivananda Yoga**: Emphasizes the Five Points of Yoga: proper exercise, proper breathing, proper relaxation, proper diet, and positive thinking and meditation.
10. **Kripalu Yoga**: Focuses on the development of a compassionate and aware relationship with the body and the mind.
