Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in ancient India over 5,000 years ago. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit word "yuj" meaning "to unite" or "to join." It is a practice that aims to unite the body, mind, and spirit, promoting overall well-being and harmony.

Traditionally, yoga was a philosophical system that encompassed physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), meditation, and other practices to cultivate awareness, balance, and inner peace. The ultimate goal of yoga is to realize one's true nature, or Self, and to achieve liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

In modern times, yoga has evolved into various styles and forms, including:

1. **Hatha Yoga**: Focuses on physical postures (asanas) and breathing techniques (pranayama) to prepare the body for meditation.
2. **Vinyasa Yoga**: Links movement with breath, flowing from one pose to another.
3. **Ashtanga Yoga**: A fast-paced, physically demanding style that involves synchronized breathing and movement.
4. **Iyengar Yoga**: Emphasizes precise alignment, the use of props, and the development of strength, balance, and flexibility.
5. **Kundalini Yoga**: Focuses on the release of energy in the body through postures, breathing, and meditation.
6. **Bikram Yoga**: Practices in a heated room to promote sweating and detoxification.
7. **Yin Yoga**: A slower-paced, meditative practice that targets the deeper tissues of the body, such as the connective tissues.
8. **Restorative Yoga**: Uses props to support the body in relaxing postures, promoting relaxation and rejuvenation.
9. **Power Yoga**: A fast-paced, physically demanding style that builds strength, endurance, and flexibility.
10. **Yoga Nidra**: A guided deep relaxation practice that induces a state of conscious sleep.
