Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in ancient India over 5,000 years ago. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj" meaning "to unite" or "to join," and it aims to unite the body, mind, and spirit through various practices.

Yoga involves a combination of physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation to promote relaxation, flexibility, balance, strength, and overall well-being. The practice is designed to calm the mind, balance the body, and cultivate a sense of inner peace and awareness.

There are several branches of yoga, each with its unique focus and emphasis:

1. **Hatha Yoga**: Focuses on physical postures (asanas) and breathing techniques (pranayama) to prepare the body for meditation.
2. **Raja Yoga**: Emphasizes the Eight Limbs of Yoga, which include the yamas, niyamas, asanas, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, and samadhi.
3. **Kundalini Yoga**: Concentrates on the release of energy in the body through postures, breathing, and meditation.
4. **Bhakti Yoga**: Focuses on the practice of devotion and love for the divine.
5. **Jnana Yoga**: Emphasizes the Pursuit of Wisdom and Self-Realization through study and contemplation.
6. **Karma Yoga**: Focuses on the practice of selfless action and service to others.
7. **Mantra Yoga**: Uses sound and vibration to create a meditative state.
8. **Yin Yoga**: Involves slow-paced, meditative postures that target the deeper tissues of the body.
9. **Vinyasa Yoga**: Links movement with breath, flowing from one posture to another.
10. **Restorative Yoga**: Uses props to support the body in relaxing postures, promoting relaxation and rejuvenation.
