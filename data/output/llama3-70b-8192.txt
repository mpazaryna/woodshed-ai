Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in ancient India over 5,000 years ago. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj" meaning "to unite" or "to join."

Traditionally, yoga is a holistic discipline that aims to unite the body, mind, and spirit through various practices, including postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), meditation, and relaxation. The ultimate goal of yoga is to attain a state of balance, harmony, and unity within oneself, as well as with the universe.

In modern times, yoga has evolved into various styles and forms, including:

1. **Hatha Yoga**: A traditional and classical form of yoga that focuses on physical postures (asanas) and breathing techniques (pranayama).

5. **Kundalini Yoga**: A spiritual style of yoga that focuses on the release of energy in the body through postures, breathing techniques, and meditation.
6. **Bikram Yoga**: A style of yoga that involves a set sequence of postures in a heated room.
7. **Yin Yoga**: A slow-paced and meditative style of yoga that targets the deeper tissues of the body, such as the connective tissues.
8. **Restorative Yoga**: A gentle and therapeutic style of yoga that involves using props to support the body in relaxing postures.
9. **Power Yoga**: A fast-paced and physically demanding style of yoga that is designed to build strength, endurance, and flexibility.
