Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in ancient India over 5,000 years ago. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj" meaning "to unite" or "to join." Yoga is often referred to as a union of the body, mind, and spirit, and its practice aims to bring balance, harmony, and overall well-being to an individual.

Traditionally, yoga consists of eight limbs, as described in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, a foundational text of yoga philosophy:

1. **Yamas** (universal ethics): principles of moral conduct, such as non-violence, truthfulness, and self-control.
2. **Niyamas** (personal observances): practices that promote self-reflection, self-control, and inner purity.
3. **Asanas** (postures): physical poses that aim to balance and harmonize the body, preparing it for meditation.
4. **Pranayama** (breath control): techniques to regulate and control the breath, influencing the body's energy and mental state.
5. **Pratyahara** (sense withdrawal): practices that help quiet the senses, turning inward and preparing for meditation.
6. **Dharana** (concentration): focus and concentration practices to train the mind.
7. **Dhyana** (meditation): a state of deep contemplation and connection with the inner self.
8. **Samadhi** (enlightenment): the ultimate goal of yoga, characterized by a state of unity, peace, and liberation.

In modern times, yoga has evolved to encompass various styles, each with its unique focus and approach. Some popular styles include:

1. **Hatha Yoga**: a traditional and classical style that focuses on physical postures (asanas) and breathing techniques (pranayama).
2. **Vinyasa Yoga**: a flowing style that links movement with breath, often with a more dynamic and physically challenging approach.
3. **Ashtanga Yoga**: a fast-paced, physically demanding style that involves a set sequence of postures.
4. **Iyengar Yoga**: a style that emphasizes precise alignment, the use of props, and the development of strength, balance, and flexibility.
5. **Kundalini Yoga**: a spiritual style that focuses on the release of energy in the body through postures, breathing, and meditation.
6. **Bikram Yoga**: a style that involves a set sequence of postures in a heated room, aiming to promote detoxification and physical health.
7. **Yin Yoga**: a slow-paced, meditative style that targets the deeper tissues of the body, such as the connective tissues.
8. **Restorative Yoga**: a gentle style that involves using props to support the body in relaxing postures, promoting relaxation and rejuvenation.
9. **Power Yoga**: a fast-paced and physically challenging style that builds strength, endurance, and flexibility.
10. **Yoga Nidra**: a style that involves guided meditation and deep relaxation, often used for stress relief and overall well-being.
