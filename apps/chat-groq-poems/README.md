# Text Generation

This is a small example of using a prompt to have an AI model respond with either a haiku or a limerick.  While the application may be called st_haiku.py, it is simply using the [LangChain ChatPrompTemplate](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/quick_start/#chatprompttemplate) to create a chat interaction with the model.  It provides a prompt abstraction layer. 

## AI Text Generation Defined by Google Gemini

AI text generation is like a fancy copycat machine for words. Through a process of training it learns the patterns of how words fit together, like how you learned the alphabet and how to make sentences. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **AI:** Stands for Artificial Intelligence, it's like a smart computer program that can learn.
* **Text:** This refers to written words, like the words you're reading now. 
* **Generation:**  This means creating something new.

So, AI text generation takes a bunch of existing text, like books or articles, and learns how those words are used together. Then, it can use that knowledge to create new pieces of writing,  like poems, news reports, or even funny scripts! 

Think of it like learning a new language. By reading lots of books in French, you eventually understand how French words work together. AI text generation does the same thing, but with tons and tons of written information to learn from. 

## AI Text Generation Explained to a Child by Google Gemini

Imagine you have a giant box filled with all the words and stories in the world. That's kind of what AI text generation is like! It's a special computer program that can look at all those words and stories, and then use them to create something new.

Think of it like playing with building blocks. You take a bunch of different blocks and put them together to make a cool castle. AI text generation is similar, but instead of blocks, it uses words to build things like poems, funny stories, or even new parts of your favorite books!

It's like having a super fun helper that can come up with new ideas to play with words. It can't write a whole story by itself yet, but it can be a great partner to spark your imagination and help you get started on your own amazing stories!
