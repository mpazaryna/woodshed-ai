Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy and practice that combines physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation to promote physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj," meaning "to unite" or "to join."

Yoga is often characterized by its focus on the following key elements:

1. **Physical Postures (Asanas)**: Yoga poses help to improve flexibility, balance, strength, and relaxation. There are over 100 recognized hatha yoga postures, each with specific benefits and challenges.
2. **Breathing Techniques (Pranayama)**: Yogic breathing practices, such as alternate nostril breathing, help to control the breath, calm the mind, and balance the body's energy.
3. **Meditation and Relaxation**: Yoga includes various meditation techniques, such as focusing on a mantra, a visualization, or simply being present in the moment, to quiet the mind and cultivate inner peace.
4. **Mindfulness and Awareness**: Yoga encourages awareness of the body, thoughts, and emotions, promoting greater self-awareness and non-judgmental acceptance.

The goals of yoga practice vary depending on the individual's intentions and the type of yoga being practiced. Some common benefits and outcomes of yoga include:
